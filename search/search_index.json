You can go through these store migration considerations . This will help to ensure that your store migration goes as smoothly as possible. The steps that you need to take to migrate your store to Shopify depend on how your store is set up. The migration process could be complicated if your store has large amounts of data in multiple sets. If you're not sure how to complete the migration steps yourself, then you might want to hire a Shopify Expert to help you with the process. Setting up your online store After you've set up Shopify , most of the work is done. Your online store will automatically use your Shopify settings for checkout and order fulfillment. Your products will automatically appear on your online store. Your online store is automatically assigned a unique .myshopify website address where your customers can find you. There are a few steps you should follow before launching to make sure your online store is ready for customers. Products Your products are the goods, digital downloads, services, and gift cards that you sell. You add a product in Shopify by entering product details and uploading product images. If your product has options, like size or color, then you can add a variant (the different versions of a product, such as size or color.) for each combination of options. When you are adding or updating a product, you can make the product available to one or more of your sales channels. You view, add, update, and organize all of your products and variants from the Products page in the Shopify admin. Helpful links: Adding and updating products Product details Variants Product images Creating product collections Selling online gift cards Importing and exporting products Searching for products and filtering your product list Managing your inventory Selling services or digital products Metafields Variants You add variants to a product that comes in more than one option, such as size or color. Each combination of options for a product is a variant for that product. For example, suppose that you sell T-shirts with two options: size and color. The size option has three values: small, medium, and large. The color option has two values: blue and green. One specific variant from these options is a small, blue T-shirt. You can see how many variants a product has in the Inventory column of the Products page. For products that don't have any variants, the Pricing, Inventory, and Shipping sections are shown on the product details page. After you add variants, those sections are no longer shown on the product details page. Helpful links: Adding variants Editing variants for an existing product Collections You can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. Here are a few examples of collections that you might create: clothes for men, women, or children items of a certain type, such as lamps, cushions, or rugs items on sale items in a certain size or color seasonal products, such as holiday cards and decorations After you create a collection, it can be shown on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products that are in the collection. Your customers can then click a product image on the collection page to visit a specific product's page. You can help customers find and view collections by adding links to the collections in a menu in your store's navigation. The exact layout and appearance of collection pages depends on your theme. You can view, create, and edit collections from the Collections page of your Shopify admin. Helpful links: Collection types Automated collections Manual collections Adding links to collections Managing collections on your sales channels Collection layout and appearance Selling gift cards A gift card is a special type of product. Its value can be used as payment toward future orders from your online store. The gift card feature is available on the Shopify plan and above. You can sell a gift card like any other product. You can also issue a gift card to a customer for free as a reward or incentive. When you fulfill an order with a gift card, the customer receives an email that contains a unique gift card code that they can use at checkout to redeem its value: Helpful links: Adding or updating gift card products Changing gift card settings Issuing free gift cards Managing gift cards Redeeming gift cards FAQs Importing and exporting products If you want to transfer a large amount of product information between Shopify and another system, then you can use a specially-formatted spreadsheet to import or export that data. Shopify uses CSV (comma-separated value) files to perform this kind of bulk task. If you're transferring information from Oberlo, then see Dropshipping with Oberlo instead. Helpful links: Using CSV files Importing products with a CSV file Exporting products Solutions to common product CSV import problems Searching for products and filtering your product list All your products are listed in the Products area in Shopify. 50 products are listed on each page. To organize the list of products, and to find products in a list that spans many pages, you can sort, search, and filter the list. By default, your product list is sorted alphabetically (from A to Z) by product name. The way that your products are sorted or filtered in the Products area of the admin doesn't affect how your products are shown in your online store. If you need to change the way that your products appear to customers in your online store, then change the sort order for the products in a collection. Helpful links: Sort your product list Filter your product list Search for a product Save a product search or filtered product list Managing inventory Inventory is the quantity of a particular product that is available for sale. Inventory tracking can help you avoid selling products that have run out of stock, or let you know when you need to order or make more of your product. You can set up inventory tracking, view your inventory, and adjust your inventory counts in the Inventory area of Shopify. You can also view the history of inventory adjustments for products and variants whose inventory is being tracked by Shopify.

If you're selling a digital product, then you'll also need to use an app to provide a download link to your product. Helpful links: Disable shipping for a digital product Digital download apps Configure email templates What to do next Metafields You can use metafields to add custom fields to objects such as products, customers, and orders. Metafields are useful for storing specialized information, such as part numbers, customer titles, or blog post summaries. They can be used by apps and channels to track data for internal use. For example, you can use metafields in the following ways: Add fields to a resource (such as a product, product variant, or customer). Customize the appearance of your storefront and show more information. Store and transfer data between your store and another ecommerce system such as a CRM, ERP, or IMS. Track internal data that an app needs. You need to use an app to create and manage metafields. Metafields have three parts: Namespace - A category or container that differentiates your metadata from other metafields. Key - The name of the metafield. Value - The content of the metafield. In most cases, the value is what will be displayed on the storefront or used by the app. For more examples, see The metafield object . Pages If you have a Shopify online store, then you can create webpages in your Shopify admin. Webpages contain information that rarely changes or that customers will reference often, like an \"About Us\" page or a \"Contact Us\" page. You can also add a blog to your online store for content that you'll be updating regularly, or if you want to encourage feedback. Helpful links: Add a new webpage to your online store Add content to a webpage Edit a webpage Edit the search engine listing for a webpage Delete a webpage Publish or unpublish webpages in bulk Blogs Your Shopify online store comes with a built-in blogging engine.

There are a few reasons why you might upload files to Shopify: You want to add an image in the content of a webpage, blog post, product page, or collection page. You want to add an image or logo to customize your theme. You want to make a file available for customers to download. In most cases, it's easier to upload image files directly when you're adding content to a webpage, blog post, product page, or collection page. You can also upload images directly when you're customizing your theme. After you upload an image, you can copy its URL from the Files page. If you want to make a file available for download, then you need to upload it on the Files page in Shopify and then add a link to it in a page's content or in your online store navigation. Menus and links After you add products and create collections, webpages, store policies, or blog posts, you need to organize them on your online store so that customers will be able to find them. You can view and change your online store navigation from the Navigation page in your Shopify admin. The appearance and location of menus depend on your store's theme. Helpful links: Understanding navigation Add, remove, or edit menu items in your online store Set up drop-down menus in your online store URL redirects Preferences You can edit the title and meta description of your online store, add tracking codes, or enable a password page or checkout protection on the Preferences page.

When a customer checks out, they can choose to pay for their order using any of the methods that you've enabled in the Payment providers area of Shopify. You can enable a variety of payment methods using Shopify. There are a few different things to consider when you're choosing which payment methods to offer. If you want to let your customers pay using a credit card, then you can use Shopify Payments or a third-party provider. There are also several ways for customers to pay online without using a credit card, like PayPal, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay. You might also want to accept alternative methods of payment like cryptocurrency. When choosing a payment provider, consider the countries where your business is located and where your customers live. Shopify's list of payment gateways by country can help you find out which payment gateway are available in your country and what currency they support. You manage all your store's payment methods in the Payment providers area of Shopify.

You manage your domain settings for your online store on the Domains page in your Shopify admin. If you use the wholesale channel, then you manage the domain settings for your wholesale store on the Domains page in that channel. By default, your primary domain is in the form of examplestore.myshopify.com, but you can buy a different custom domain or use a custom domain that you already own. Helpful links: Adding domains Managing domains Domains terminology Shipping You manage all your store's shipping settings on the Shipping page in your Shopify admin.

Although tax laws and regulations are complex and can change often, you can set up Shopify to automatically handle most common sales tax calculations. You can also set up tax overrides to address unique tax laws and situations. Shopify uses many default sales tax rates, which are updated regularly. If you use the default rates, then you need to confirm that they are current and correct for your particular circumstances. You can override them whenever necessary. Shopify doesn\u2019t file or remit your sales taxes for you. You might need to register your business with your local or federal tax authority to handle your sales tax. The calculations and reports that Shopify provides should help make things easier when it\u2019s time to file and pay your taxes. You should always check with a local tax authority or a tax accountant to make sure that you charge your customers the correct sales tax rates, and to make sure you file and remit the taxes correctly.
